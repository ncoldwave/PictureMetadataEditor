**PictureMetadata™** is a universal metadata analyzer, converter, and validation tool  
for professional imaging workflows and AI data pipelines. Different Business plan for testing my new *"Waving Blue Sea"* economical theory.

> "Every pixel has story."

## Features

- Metadata extraction and conversion  
- EXIF, IPTC, XMP, etc. support  
- AI-based metadata consistency check

- **Provenance by default**: every image can be verified (origin, metadata, AI disclosure).  
- **Compliance-ready**: GDPR, HIPAA, C2PA, EU AI Act, DMCA compatibility.  
- **Scalable APIs**: from hobbyist usage to Facebook-scale hyperscale workloads.  
- **Trust ecosystem**: metadata editing → professional workflows → compliance → enterprise/government integration → social sharing.  

## Roadmap Highlights

- **Year 1 (MVP → Enterprise Plus)**:  
  - 10-20k sustained RPS, 2-region active/passive

- **Year 2 (Hyperscale build)**:  
  - 50k+ RPS, 200k burst, 3-region active/active  
  - Compliance APIs (AI detection, forensics, blockchain audit)  
  - Government & healthcare pilots  

- **Year 3 (FB-ready Hyperscale)**:  
  - 200k burst, 99.99% SLA with financial penalties
