# PictureMetadata‚Ñ¢

**PictureMetadata‚Ñ¢** is a universal metadata analyzer, converter, and validation tool  
for professional imaging workflows and AI data pipelines with different Business plan for testing my new *"Waving Blue Ocean Strategy‚Ñ¢"* economical theory.

> "Every pixel has history.‚Ñ¢"

## Features

- Metadata extraction and conversion  
- EXIF, IPTC, XMP, etc. support

- **Provenance by default**: every image can be verified (origin, metadata, AI disclosure).  
- **Compliance-ready**: GDPR, HIPAA, C2PA, EU AI Act, DMCA compatibility.  
- **Scalable APIs**: from hobbyist usage to Facebook-scale hyperscale workloads.  
- **Trust ecosystem**: metadata editing ‚Üí professional workflows ‚Üí compliance ‚Üí enterprise/government integration ‚Üí social sharing.  

## Roadmap Highlights

- **Year 1 (MVP ‚Üí Enterprise Plus)**:  
  - 10-20k sustained RPS, 2-region active/passive  
  - First enterprise pilots (stock, clinics, agencies)  

- **Year 2 (Hyperscale build)**:  
  - 50k+ RPS, 200k burst, 3-region active/active  
  - Compliance APIs (AI detection, forensics, blockchain audit)  
  - Government & healthcare pilots  

- **Year 3 (FB-ready Hyperscale)**:  
  - 200k burst, 99.99% SLA with financial penalties
