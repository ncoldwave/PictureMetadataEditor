## Proof of Authorship  

This repository and its commits serve as timestamped digital records proving authorship, creation date, and development history of the materials contained herein.  
Each commit is cryptographically verifiable through SHA-1 and SHA-256 hashes within the Git version control system.  

No source code or confidential content is publicly disclosed; however, logs and hash identifiers are available for verification upon request by authorized authorities or intellectual property offices.  

## Proofed Repository Purpose

<!-- TODO -->
Serves as the overarching eternal core unifying digital health, legal compliance, and AI infrastructure under a secure intellectual property and licensing framework. Company name.

## Origin Reference (if needed)

First documents and concept drafts originated in NexorAA-VisRae™ repository (proof chain 2025-02-18).

## Verification Reference

Validation can be performed by matching the SHA-256 checksum in SHA256SUMS.txt against the archived repository snapshot (ZIP).

To verify a project level proof:

```bash - TODO for verification
# Use the provided project repository zip file or recreate the proof ZIP from Git if you have access:
git archive --format=zip --output <Project>-<datetime>-<commitID>.zip <commitID>

# Compute SHA-256
shasum -a 256 <Project>-<datetime>-<commitID>.zip

# Compare with ProofArchive/SHA256SUMS.txt
...

# GPG signature verification
...

# Verify RFC 3161 TSA timestamp
openssl ts -verify -in proof.tsr -queryfile proof.tsq -data <Project>-<datetime>-<commitID>.zip -CAfile cacert.pem

# Or use the provided shell script for all steps for all files
# install script
chmod +x verify-repository.sh
dos2unix verify-repository.sh
dos2unix .config

# run the script
./verify-repository.sh
```
